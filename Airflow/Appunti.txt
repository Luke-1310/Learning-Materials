Airflow DAG: Coding your first DAG for Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1-0hwFZRQ

DAG stands for directed acyclic graph which means that it is a graph with nodes directed edges and no cycles and it is a data pipeline 
in airflow. An operator is nothing more than a task in our DAG, to be more specific it is the one who actually execute a task, if you want
to execute a Python task then you'll probably use this operator "Pythonoperator". Every time you add a task you're also adding an operator.
